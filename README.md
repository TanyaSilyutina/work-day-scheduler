# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

I have created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. 
This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
While working on this project, I gained a better understanding of jQuery syntax and how to work with local storage.

## Usage

Please navigate to the deployed application: [Work Day Scheduler](https://tanyasilyutina.github.io/work-day-scheduler/)

To enter a to-do item, please click on the text entry field, enter the to-do, and save it by clicking the blue save icon:
